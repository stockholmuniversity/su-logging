# Logging for Stockholm University

Easy to use logging for Stockholm University.

## Usage

```python
from su.logging import logging

logger = logging.getLogger("myapp")
logger.info("My INFO message")
```

For easier developing you can also enable console logging:
```python
from su.logging import console, logging

logger = logging.getLogger("myapp")
logger.info("My INFO message")
```

### Structured logging
We use
[logstash_formatter](https://github.com/ulule/python-logstash-formatter/)'s
`LogstashFormatterV1` and remove some unused/unnecesary fields.

Depend on `su-logging[structured]` in e.g. your `requirements.txt` and then:
```python
from su.logging import structured, logging

logger = logging.getLogger("myapp")
logger.info("User logged in", extra={"user": "simlu"})

try:
    raise Exception("User performed illegal activity")
except Exception as e:
    logger.exception(e, extra={"user": "simlu"})
```

### Container usage
In Containers, which usually adhere to the 12 factor apps manifesto, you
usually log to STDOUT and let your container engine deal with them. Usually you
don't have a syslog server listening on localhost:514 either. So to enable
structured logging to STDOUT and disable syslog we need to:
* Import `structured` after `console`
* Remove the `SysLogHandler`

```python
from su.logging import logging, console, structured

for h in list(logging.getLogger().handlers):
    if isinstance(h, logging.handlers.SysLogHandler):
        logging.getLogger().removeHandler(h)

logger = logging.getLogger("myapp")
logger.info("My INFO message")
```
